# *** RandomForest Validate-----------------------------------------------------
#'
#' Random Forest is a robust tool for identifying the features that contribute
#' to correct phenotype prediction. For optimal performance of the model, it is
#' recommended to remove the highly correlated features before training and
#' testing the model. The mzlog_rf_correlation function utilizes the
#' findCorrelation function of the Caret package to isolate and remove the
#' highly correlated features. The new data set with these feature removed will
#' be used for the remaining functions of random forest. The mzlog_rf_select
#' function utilizes the Caret rfeControl function to determine which features
#' of the data set are the best predictors for phenotype and how many features
#' should be considered in the model. Using the reduced, likely predictors only
#' data set will reduce the resources needed for the remainder of random forest
#' processing. The mzlog_rf function divides the data set randomly into sections
#' for training and testing the model. The model will output a coefficient of
#' relevance for each feature, essentially ranking the features based on how
#' fundamental the feature was in predicting the phenotype. The rf_validate
#' function is used to compare the predictions of the model to the actual
#' phenotype of the sample. The accuracy of the model is also output.

#' function is used to compare the predictions of the model to the actual

#' the accuracy of the model is truly based on biological phenotype, a
#' permutation of the data is used. The rf_permuted function randomly assigns a
#' phenotype to each of the samples and feeds this permuted data set through the
#' model. If the accuracy is significantly greater than 50%, the user should
#' reconsider the model.
