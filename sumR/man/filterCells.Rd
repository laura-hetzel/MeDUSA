\title{Filter cells without measurements (only containing NA values)}
\usage{
filterCells(exp, assay = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{exp}{SummarizedExperiment object obtained after alignment}

\item{assay}{The assay to be checked. Defaults to the assay at index 1}
}
\value{
SummarizedExperiment without cells that have no measured values
in the assay given.
}
\description{
Not all cells will contain the same peaks after alignment. For
peaks that are not found in cells, an \code{NA} value is used instead. This
function checks if the entire cell does not only contain NAs and remove
them if so.
}
\details{
During post-processing, several filters may be applied to remove
either compounds or peaks to reduce false positive hits. In some cases,
cells with few peaks may not contain any peaks at all. This function
helps in detecting and removing such cells.

\examples{
# Read example data
data("sumRnegative")

# Set colData and phenotype
df <- read.csv(system.file("cellData.csv", package = "sumR"), row.names = 1)
sumRnegative <- addCellData(sumRnegative, df)
sumRnegative <- setPhenotype(sumRnegative, "Treatment")

# Remove any cells without a value in the assay
filterCells(sumRnegative)
}
